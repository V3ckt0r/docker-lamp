tutum-docker-lamp
=================

A bare build LAMP image (APACHE + PHP + MYSQL)


Usage
-----

To create the image `tutum/lamp`, execute the following command on the tutum-docker-lamp folder:

	docker build -t vect0r/lamp .

push to registry/docker hub:

	docker push tutum/lamp


Running image
------------------------------

Start your image binding below ports:

	docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 3306:3306 vect0r/lamp

Test your deployment:

	curl http://localhost/

Hello world!


Inspect running container
-----------------------------------

If you would like to connect to your container and have a poke around, just do;

docker exec -it <imageid> bash


Connecting to the bundled MySQL server from within the container
----------------------------------------------------------------

The bundled MySQL server has a `root` user with no password for local connections.
Simply connect from your PHP code with this user:

	<?php
	$mysql = new mysqli("localhost", "root");
	echo "MySQL Server info: ".$mysql->host_info;
	?>


Connecting to the bundled MySQL server from outside the container
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The first time that you run your container, a new user `admin` with all privileges
will be created in MySQL with a random password. To get the password, check the logs
of the container by running:

	docker logs $CONTAINER_ID

You will see an output like the following:

	========================================================================
	You can now connect to this MySQL Server using:

	    mysql -uadmin -p47nnf4FweaKu -h<host> -P<port>

	Please remember to change the above password as soon as possible!
	MySQL user 'root' has no password but only allows local connections
	========================================================================

In this case, `47nnf4FweaKu` is the password allocated to the `admin` user.

You can then connect to MySQL:

	 mysql -uadmin -p47nnf4FweaKu

Remember that the `root` user does not allow connections from outside the container -
you should use this `admin` user instead!


Setting a specific password for the MySQL server admin account
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to use a preset password instead of a random generated one, you can
set the environment variable `MYSQL_PASS` to your specific password when running the container:

	docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_PASS="mypass" tutum/lamp

You can now test your new admin password:

	mysql -uadmin -p"mypass"
